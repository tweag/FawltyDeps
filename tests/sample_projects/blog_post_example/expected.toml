  This is the example being used in the blog post that announces FawltyDeps
  on Tweag's blog: https://www.tweag.io/blog/
  This example project is contrived to demonstrate what FawltyDeps can do, and
  and what benefits it can bring to a Python project. The project includes:
  - A couple of undeclared dependencies, one that should obviously have been
    declared, and another that is conditionally depended upon.
  - A couple of unused dependencies, one that is obviously extraneous, and
    should be removed from the project, and another that points to a commonly
    used tool, where the correct course of action is rather to tell FawltyDeps
    to look the other way.
