# The SHA256 checksum above can be found by running `sha256sum` on the
# downloaded tarball. It is used to ensure that we run tests against the
# expected revision of the 3rd-party project.

# Below are our experiments which run FawltyDeps with various options on the
# above (unpacked) tarball. Each table represents an experiment with the
# command-line arguments we pass to FawltyDeps (in `args`, --json is implicitly
# added by test_real_projects), as well as our expectations for what FawltyDeps
# should return in that scenario. These expectations are encoded as lists of
# import/dependency names which we expect to be present in the corresponding
# parts of the JSON: imports, declared_deps, undeclared_deps, and unused_deps.
# All these fields are optional, and the verification will be skipped for
# missing fields.
