# expected revision of the 3rd-party project.

# Below are our experiments which run FawltyDeps with various options on the
# above (unpacked) tarball. Each table represents an experiment with the
# command-line arguments we pass to FawltyDeps (in `args`, --json is implicitly
# added by test_real_projects), as well as our expectations for what FawltyDeps
# should return in that scenario. These expectations are encoded as lists of
# import/dependency names which we expect to be present in the corresponding
# parts of the JSON: imports, declared_deps, undeclared_deps, and unused_deps.
# All these fields are optional, and the verification will be skipped for
# missing fields.

    Running FD on the TheAlgorithms/Python project, with some requirements

    This solved the "placeholder package" problem for qiskit and tensorflow
    by side-stepping it with a custom_mapping.
"""
# TheAlgorithms/Python depends on a couple of "placeholder" packages:
# - The qiskit package does not provide the "qiskit" import name, but depends
#   on other packages to populate the "qiskit" namespace.
# - The same is true for tensorflow on Windows: The package itself is only 1.9kB
#   and does not provide any import names at all, rather it depends on another
#   package, tensorflow-intel, which contains the actual meat (266MB).
#
# Since we `pip install` with `--no-deps`, the dependencies of these packages
# are not automatically present in our Python environment. But even if they
# were, FawltyDeps would still not be able to recognize the connection between
# the placeholder package and its transitive dependencies, and would therefore
# still report the placeholder as _both_ an undeclared and unused dependency!
#
# The best way to work around this is to provide a custom mapping to resolve
# these placeholders as they are intended to be used. We configure the custom
# mapping by pointing to THIS file as a config file for FawltyDeps, which will
# then parse the [tool.fawltydeps.custom_mapping] section below.
