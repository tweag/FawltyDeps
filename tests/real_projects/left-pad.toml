# The SHA256 checksum above can be found by running `sha256sum` on the
# downloaded tarball. It is used to ensure that we run tests against the
# expected revision of the 3rd-party project.

# Below are our expectations for running FawltyDeps on the above (unpacked)
# tarball. Each table represents the expectations of a corresponding test case
# inside ../test_real_projects.py. All tables are optional: Removing a table
# will disable the corresponding test case. An empty table means that we expect
# FawltyDeps to produce zero results/empty output for that test.
#
# Inside each table, we map filenames to lists of relevant packages (imports or
# dependencies) that we expect FawltyDeps to return for that test. This is
# described in more detail under each table:

[imports]
# What we expect `fawltydeps --list-imports` to return for this project.
# Key: filename containing import statements
# Value: list (set) of external packages imported
"setup.py" = [
    "setuptools",
]

[declared_deps]
# What we expect `fawltydeps --list-deps` to return for this project.
# Key: filename containing declared dependencies
# Value: list (set) of packages names that are declared

[undeclared_deps]
# What we expect `fawltydeps --check-undeclared` to return for this project.
# Key: filename containing import statements
# Value: list (set) of external packages imported without being declared
"setup.py" = [
    "setuptools",
]

[unused_deps]
# What we expect `fawltydeps --check-unused` to return for this project.
# Key: filename containing declared dependencies
# Value: list (set) of external packages imported
